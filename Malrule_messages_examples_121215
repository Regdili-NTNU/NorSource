UPDATES LH201215 - 3 new message formulations:

mal-s-adv-sentence-final-rule
In main clauses, sentential adverbs must be placed directly after the finite verb, and in subordinate clauses, right before the finite verb.


mal-n_sg_strong-for-c_sg_strong-finstr_infl_rule
The adjective "GET-PHRASE" is conjugated as neuter gender, but here it must agree in non-neuter.


mal-plural_or_weak-for-c_sg_strong-finstr_infl_rule
The adjective "GET-PHRASE" has a form which can serve as either weak or plural, but here the form must be strong singular. See 'generate'.

Some 'REMAINS' with å-og are resolved



UPDATES LH121215

This rule should be omitted:
mal-plural_or_weak-for-n_sg_strong-finstr_infl_rule	
The adjective "GET-PHRASE" should agree with the neuter gender noun it modifies.	
For instance, we get the following response for the sentence below:
The adjective "store" should agree with the masculine or feminine noun it modifies.	
Store hus brenner. Birgit: Dette er jo en korrekt norsk setning. Skjønner ikke helt. Og hus er jo intetkjønn. Samme kommentar som over.
TRANSLATION:
L’aggettivo "store" dovrebbe concordare con il nome neutro che modifica.
ACTION: 
If "Fire argument holder" had been bad, this would have been the type one wants to mal-mark. Maybe it is, but as the noun-inflection system stands, 'hus' and 'argument' belong to the same supertype, and the sentence is accepted by the same rule as accepts "Fire hus brenner".
We should leave it at this, 
comment the rule away in malgram DONE

This rule is superfluous as long as all d/de-verbs are allowed to conjugate with et/et:
mal-et_infl-for-de-lrule	
The form "GET-WORD-RIGHT" has a wrong ending. This verb ends with -"et" or -"de" in past tense, and -"et" or -"d" in perfect and passive participle.
For instance, we get the following response for the sentence below:
The form "eiet" has a wrong ending. This verb ends with -"et" or -"de" in past tense, and -"et" or -"d" in perfect and passive participle.
Mannen behøvet bilen.
TRANSLATION:
La forma "behøvet" ha la desinenza sbagliata. Questo verbo finisce in -"et" oppure in -"de" all’imperfetto, e in -"et" oppure -"d" nel participio passato e passivo.
ACTION: 
1. Ideally, distinguish better between those verbs that allow free variation, and thise which don't - with due regard to all Norw. idiosyncracies.
2. But in the meanwhile, remove the message and comment out the mal-rule.
