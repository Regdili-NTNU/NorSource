ic-gend-noun-lxm := noun-lexeme.


; this type, with its immediate descendants, is in order to distinguish all the noun lexemes in lex4.na-lrg.tdl from measure-noun-lxm and its descendants, so that these 55 000 items do not all take part in rules designed for measure-nps. All of the types dir-, relanim-, reganim-, relinan- and reginan- have SORT specifications which are subtypes of 'referential-thing', hence when one day all 55 000 are annotated with regard to these options, they stay within the general large category, even though we are not explicitly subtyping them all under ref-noun-lexemes. In other words, once we glue in 'lanim-', 'ganim-', 'linan-' and 'ginan-' behind the 're' in 'neut-re-noun-lxm' etc., the ref-noun-lexeme with its immediate descendants will cease to play a role in the system. But since that day may never come, it will be a useful temporary type to have.

; by     SYNSEM.LOCAL.BND-RESP #2,  we manage to catch reflexives that fail to have a binder. Of course, by this point, they should have been bound anyway, but if we don't mediate the track upwards, there is no arrest made.
; However, with this, "det hjelper å sette seg" fails to parse, because 'seg', being ref-ind, fails to unify with the expletive 'det', as the mechanics dictate. TODO is to devise a way of releasing the reflexive at the point when absinf combines, but that we don't have yet. Hence we get a lot of overgenerations of non-bound reflexives. Short term solution: create a special version of the present rule for absinf-combination.

"Per å Ola sover" in malgram. Generation in lkb, but not in ACE.

Alle EPene skal danne et tre, men du har for få hull.
 
Jeg velger h6 som top.
 
h6:node(h7=h3,h8=h9) ---> her har jeg plassert h3 i hull h7 som qeq bestemmer
h3:node()

h9:node(h10=h12,h11=h16) --> h12 plassert i h10 ifølge qeq
h12:node()

h16:node(h17=h13,h18=h23) --> h13 plassert i h17 ifølge qeq
h13:node()
h23:node()
 
For å danne resten av treet så plasserer jeg h9 i h8 og h16 i h11.
Så legger jeg h23 i h18.

Noder som ikke er plassert
h21:node()
h19:node()
 
Da har du ikke et tre, men du har tre.

Hei,

Kan du se hva som mangler i nedenstående for at h19 og h21 skulle være hypernormally connected?
('og-connect_rel' er her kvantoren som binder x2).  Jeg antar dette er hva som hindrer generering for 'Ola å Per sover' i ACE. (Generering går greit i LKB.)

A semantic error occurred while decoding the graph.The dominance children h19 and h21 of the root h9 are not hypernormally connected with each other.

	The word "å" is not a conjunction, try using "og" instead. More description

; works well for 'jo snillere du er, jo snillere er jeg', corect mrs. Produces correct trees also for 'jo raskere du løper, jo snillere er jeg' and 'jo mer du spiser, jo snillere er jeg' (with 'spise' transitive), but fails to represent adverb derivation in the former, and in the latter case construing the front part as a relative constr - by itself not so bad, but probably not with the right semantics.  "jo" belongs to category degreecmpar-spec-word, in both occurrences. (Same for dess, desto.)

; For verbs, most of the inflectional effects are introduced at word level. The values under verb_inflection are inscribed under INFL-MORPH (which is a sign feature). The 'governing' phonological properties could have been given under INFLECTION, since they are lexeme properties - and INFLECTION and INFL-MORPH need not be coindexed. However, in the long run that may seem natural - so ideally, the feature PHON should house the relevant specification of infinitive 'stem' forms. For now, though, we try with INFLECTION as housing info that somehow affects the choice of inflectional rules - that is consistent with design so far.
